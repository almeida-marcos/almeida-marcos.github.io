<h1>Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>
My name is Marcos. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computational Mathematics from the Federal University of Minas Gerais. During my undergraduate program, I actively participated in ICPC programming contests, improving my skills in using data structures to solve real-world problems.

<p>
In my final semester, I got interested in data science and machine learning when I took the course on Fundamental Statistics for Data Science. This prompted me to pursue a Master's degree in computer science, where I focused on developing an algorithm for automatically generating heterogeneous music playlists. Throughout my Master's program, I had the opportunity to learn more about statistics and machine learning, expanding my knowledge in these areas.

<p>
Following the completion of my Master's degree, I started my professional career as a data scientist at <a href="http://www.bigdata.com.br">Big Data</a>, a company dedicated to providing AI solutions to enhance our clients' revenue. In this role, I have gained valuable experience working with AWS solutions, databases, and machine learning algorithms. Additionally, I actively contribute as a software engineer, implementing algorithms and developing automated pipelines for Big Data's products.

<p>
I'm passionate about mathematical modeling, problem-solving, programming, and technology. I am continually motivated by the potential to make a meaningful impact on society through technological solutions. Moreover, I place great importance on implementing the best possible solutions, with a strong focus on code quality and extensive code testing.
